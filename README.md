<h3>C library to handle mathematical operations on arbitrary length integers.</h3>
Very useful for handling very big integers that are not handled by builtin data types.

<b>Steps to use the library  </b>  
Clone this repository  
cd into Intal folder  
type "make" in cmdline to compile  
<i>Note: check.c is the client file where the main() function takes in input for intals in char *str1 and char *str2  </i>  
./intal to run the executable  
  
Sample Input:  
cd Intal  
make  
./intal  

Sample Output:  
First intal: 1000  
Second intal: 00990  
Two intals after increment and decrement:  
1001  
00989  
Getting intal1 and intal2 back to original input:  
1000  
00990  
Max of two intals: 1000  
Sum: 1990  
Diff: 10  
Product: 990000  
Quotient: 1  
Power: 1000 ^ 990: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...
